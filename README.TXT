47.The balance does not change. For instance I had 450 in my blance  and I added -45, the error message popped up but the balance stayed 450. An error message will pop up which is what happened because the amount has to be more than 0 if not an error message will pop up.
48. The difference is that an error message does not pop up when I put 0 but it still does pop up if it is a negative number.
